# 919 ADMIN

Thank you for purchasing my custom made resource 919 ADMIN. 

**919 ADMIN** is an admin menu that I set out to create after being unsatisfied with the options that are available currently. While there are a lot of great free options such as EasyAdmin or VMenu, I found myself looking for an admin menu with a deeper integration with my framework, as well as a good graphical user interface. 919 ADMIN has been designed from the ground up to excel at those two main things.

**919 ADMIN** is _very_ closely integrated with the server framework and as such, offers a very deep level of interactivity with your RP server's players, as well as its database. Over a hundred different actions and changes can be made through the menu to yourself, your players, peds around you, objects, vehicles, and your server's database. We really tried to cover as much as possible with it.

Another crucial benefit of using **919 ADMIN** is its ease of use and simple learning curve. Your admins and moderators won't need to know how to mess with the database or enter complicated commands to **DO MORE**!

As of 12/2022, 919 ADMIN is now compatible with ESX 1.8!
