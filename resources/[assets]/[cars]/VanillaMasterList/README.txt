Head here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14o5RH_qJiGs5qohn8p8DzrNKCtYC0ovZMCsTsGlOBow/edit?usp=sharing
and make sure you copy it, then you're free to edit your own list as you see fit.

You are also free to edit any vehicle handling you see. Once purchased, this is your file to 
edit as you wish. DO NOT RESELL OR GIVE TO OTHERS, please and thank you.

Although i have tried to be as accurate as possible with top speeds in game and on the list, there may be some
differences so i apologise in advance!
