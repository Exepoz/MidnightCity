# An-engine
- Engine swap script For Qb-core
- My discord: https://discord.gg/94FQvA84vB

# Feats
- Custom Engine
- Custom Sounds
- Fully Server sync using Onesync state bags
- Cleaned and optimized and removed all the useless functions.
- Saves to database.
- Each zone has its own authorized job
- You can make it so only bosses of the jobs can engine swap
- You can add more zones for more mechanic shops

# Install
- Installation:
- Drag an-engine to your resource folder
- Import engine.sql

- True or false if you want only the boss of that job to be able to swap the engine
- ensure an-engine in the server.cfg (After Qb-core)
