## KQ_SMASH_N_GRAB INSTALLATION GUIDE [QB]

This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the KQ_SMASH_N_GRAB script for FiveM. This script requires the QBCore framework to be installed and running on your server.

## Step 1:
After downloading the script, unzip the folder and place it in the `resources` directory on your FiveM server.

## Step 2:
Add the items to your qb-core shared.lua file `qb-core/shared/items.lua` or `qb-core/shared.lua`

## Step 3:
Open the `config.lua` file in the script folder and make sure that the correct framework is enabled.

## Step 4:
After the config file has been set up, add the script to your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that it's added **after** the ESX framework, so that it loads and starts properly.

## Step 5:
Change the loot config to fit your server. Optionally add the items to your shops for players to sell

## Done
Enjoy the script
